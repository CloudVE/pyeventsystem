    Provides a mechanism for grouping related event handlers together, to

    handlers to subscribe to events through the install method, and unsubscribe
    through the uninstall method. This allows event handlers to be added and
    removed as a group. The event handler implementations will also typically
    live inside the middleware class. For example, LoggingMiddleware may
    register multiple event handlers to log data before and after calls.
    ResourceTrackingMiddleware may track all objects that are created or
